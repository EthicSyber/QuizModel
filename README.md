# QUIZ MODEL


<pre>
  I originally set out to create something I can build on overtime and I have achieved this today. 
  At its current state, the Quiz Model provides a way to feed json data tailored to the Question Handler 
  and Question object in order to represent this using the flask server on HTML.

  I have used a combination of Jinja and a custom made CSS bootstrap file for styling and 
  html template inheritance as specified using flask documentation.
